But people with open minds could find there\\'s some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album\\'s title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it\\'s actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It\\'s also a perfect length since it\\'s under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you\\'d hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There\\'s some songs she does where it\\'s more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song\\'s similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it\\'s a more low-key track but it\\'s also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one\\'s a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it\\'s not technically complex or fast but it\\'s pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There\\'s only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I\\'ve ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn\\'t do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it\\'s just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it\\'s another wordless song although it\\'s more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it\\'s a bit more song-oriented. It\\'s different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We\\'re getting into the album\\'s final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it\\'s a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya\\'s more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it\\'s another beautiful track but it\\'s also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it\\'s another slower paced track complete with \"aahs\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could\\'ve benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you\\'d think it was a bit more upbeat. While it\\'s not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it\\'s still one of her finest outings.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': '4.5; music to dream to', 'unixReviewTime': 1200528000, 'reviewTime': '01 17, 2008'}\n"
